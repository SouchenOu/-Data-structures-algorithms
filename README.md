# -Data-structures


What are C++ data structures?
-----------------------------

Data structures are formats used to organize, store, and manage data. You can use data structures to access and modify data efficiently. There are various types of data structures. The type you use will depend on the application youâ€™re using.


Data structures generally fall under these two categories:

Linear data structures: Elements are arranged sequentially (e.g. arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)
Non-linear data structures: Elements are not arranged sequentially, but are stored within different levels (e.g. trees, graphs)


1. Arrays

2. Graphs

3. Linked lists

4. Hash tables

5. Stacks and queues

6. Strings

7. Trees

  1. Binary trees
  2. Binary search trees
  3. Tries
